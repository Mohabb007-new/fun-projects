# Algorithmic fun Games - CS50AI

This repository contains fun three algorithmic game projects developed as part of the CS50AI course. Each project showcases the use of algorithms and coding techniques to solve or play games.

## Projects

1. **Crossword**  
    A crossword puzzle generator that uses backtracking and constraint satisfaction to fill in the grid with valid words.

2. **Minesweeper**  
    A Minesweeper game where the agent uses logical reasoning to identify safe cells and mines.

3. **Nim**  
    An implementation of the Nim game with an agent that learns optimal strategies through reinforcement techniques.

Explore the projects to see how algorithms and coding can be applied to solve challenging problems in games!
