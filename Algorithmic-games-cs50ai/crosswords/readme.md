# CS50 AI Crossword Challenge

This project is part of the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. The goal is to build an AI-powered crossword puzzle generator that places words into a grid based on given constraints.

## Features

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):** Utilizes backtracking and arc-consistency algorithms to solve the crossword puzzle.
- **Word Placement:** Automatically fills the crossword grid with words from a predefined vocabulary.
- **Heuristics:** Implements strategies like Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) and Least Constraining Value (LCV) for efficient solving.

## Files

- `crossword.py`: Contains the main logic for generating and solving the crossword.
- `structure.txt`: Defines the crossword grid structure.
- `words.txt`: A list of words used to populate the crossword.
- `readme.md`: Documentation for the project.
